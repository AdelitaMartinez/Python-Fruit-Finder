# Fruit Finder

## Overview
**Fruit Finder** is a Python program designed to identify fruits mentioned in a user-entered sentence. This tool utilizes a predefined list of fruits to search for matches within the input sentence.

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to assist users in identifying fruits mentioned in their input sentences. By comparing the input against a list of known fruits, the program determines which fruits, if any, are present in the sentence.

## How to Use the Program
1. **Enter a Sentence:**  
   When prompted, type a sentence that may contain references to fruits. The program will search for fruit names within this sentence.
   
2. **View the Results:**  
   The program will display any fruits found in the input sentence. If no fruits are found, it will prompt the user to try again.

## Code Explanation
The program begins by displaying a welcome message and instructions. It prompts the user to input a sentence. It then compares the input against a predefined list of fruits and identifies any fruits mentioned. If fruits are found, it displays them along with the number of fruits found and an updated input sentence with the first fruit replaced with "Brussels Sprouts". If no fruits are found, it prompts the user to try again. Finally, the program bids farewell to the user.

## Dependencies
This program does not require any external dependencies beyond Python 3.
